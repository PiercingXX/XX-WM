# Piercing WM — Work Order (Skippy)

You are Skippy, working on **Piercing WM**: a minimalist, text-first Wayland launcher/shell for Linux phones. Read `README.md` (identity), `design.md` (the UI spec — treat it as the contract), and `launcher/README.md` (code layout) before touching anything.

**Everything in Workstreams 1–10 runs on the dev machine — no phone required.** Device-gated work is quarantined at the bottom; do not attempt it.

## Ground rules

- **Spec**: `design.md` wins. Where this file and design.md disagree, design.md is right; flag the conflict in your commit message.
- **Style**: Python 3.12+, GTK4/libadwaita via `gi`, match the existing code's idiom. No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious. Text-first UI: no icon grids, no images, monochrome per theme.
- **CSS invariants** (`launcher/src/style.css`): uniform background from the active theme on every surface; children transparent; no borders anywhere except inside `.settings-page`; Space Mono default; invisible Paned separators. Don't regress these.
- **Verify before every commit**: `python3 -m py_compile launcher/src/*.py` and `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` (create `tests/` in Workstream 10 — from then on it gates everything). If you add a runtime behavior, run the shell locally (`cd launcher && PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/main.py` — it falls back to a window when layer-shell is absent) and exercise the flow.
- **Commits**: one commit per task or coherent group, imperative subject, body says what changed and how it was verified. Never commit `__pycache__`, `build/`, or `devices/*/downloads/` (gitignored).
- **Config compatibility**: `~/.config/piercing-shell/config.json` may exist from earlier runs. Every schema change needs a silent migration path (missing keys → defaults; never crash on old configs).
- **Decisions already made** (don't relitigate): keep `piercing-shell` internal naming for now (rename is user-gated, see bottom); keep the `aura` theme preset as a seventh Linux-only bonus; phoc is the compositor; lisgd owns system-level gestures via IPC.
- **Newer decisions (2026-07-18)**: the on-screen keyboard is **squeekboard** with the PiercingXX Colemak layouts (not wvkbd — design.md/README already updated); the lock screen stays ours (no phrog/phosh code, ever); DnD and Focus Mode copy the **Pixel's** behavior (design.md sections are the contract); the in-shell Settings page is **system-only** — every shell preference lives in `~/.config/piercing-shell/` (Workstream 15 supersedes the "Settings:" UI sub-items in 3.3, 4.2, 5.3, 7.5, 8.1: implement the config keys, skip the GUI rows); `linux-phone-mod` is deprecated — its installer is vendored at `scripts/reference/linux-phone-mod/` and Workstreams 9/17 port it.
- **Android parity sync (2026-07-20)**: the Android launcher's "Overhaul defaults and minimal UI" commit (`piercingxx-launcher` `ea84fbf`) is a contract change; design.md has been updated to match and is still the spec. Landed in this repo alongside the doc update: 5-slot default layout (Notes, Audio, Comms, **Calendar**, Tools) with seeded renames in `app_labels` + stock-clutter hiding + Skippy swipe-left seeding (`default_layout.apply_default_layout`, wired into `window.py` init); in-place folder expansion (widgets hide, any gesture dismisses); widget block on the 1/4 line / slots on the 2/3 line; widget order time-date-weather-battery with weather default-on; date format `Mon, Jul 20`; default font JetBrains Mono Nerd; −20% type scale; drawer search at bottom with no auto-keyboard; drawer sort A–Z ↔ install date only; synthetic "Launcher Settings" drawer entry; search-only visibility for hidden/home/folder apps; `launch:<app_id>` gesture actions (validation only — dispatch is 8.1); `muted_apps` config + notification-drop enforcement in `main.py` (menu UI is 2.3). **Kept deliberately despite Android removing them**: double-tap-to-lock (Android only dropped it because it required the accessibility service) and usage-based launch counts (still feed future default sort).
- **Android parity sync (2026-07-21)**: launcher commits `ce88e50` ("Rework app drawer and folders for one-handed use") + `65a21b7` ("Polish for release") are a contract change; design.md updated to match. The delta: drawer is a **~85% bottom sheet** (top ~15% free); **search results anchor at the bottom** above the keyboard (short sets sit at the bottom, overflowing sets read from the top); **folders expand as inline drop-downs** both in the drawer (indented under the row, re-tap/swipe-right collapses, block scrolls to center) and on home (**members drop in under the folder's slot; widgets stay visible; collapse on re-tap / member launch / re-render — gesture-dismiss is gone**); shared **folder-member long-press menu** (App info / Rename / Disable for… / Move up / Move down — no uninstall on Linux); dialogs launcher-styled with Enter-commit on rename entries. Landed with this sync: 1.4 rework + drawer sheet/anchoring (2.6). Still open: drawer folder rows (2.7), the long-press menus themselves (2.3). Android's `autoShowKeyboard`-everywhere change is **not** ported — the shell keeps "keyboard only on search tap".

## Workstream 1 — Home: 8-slot model (the big one)

The home model is **up to 8 ordered slots**, each holding an app, a pinned shortcut, or a folder (`design.md` \"Home screen\"). Current code instead renders a hardcoded `HOME_ITEMS` tree (`launcher/src/home_launcher.py:130`) plus a `pinned` list (`config.py`). Replace that with the slot model.

- [x] **1.1 Slot schema in config** — `config.py`: add `home_slots` to `DEFAULT_CONFIG`: list of ≤8 dicts, `{type: 'app'|'folder', label: str, app_id: str|None, cmd: list[str]|None, folder: [member…]|None}` where members are `{label, app_id or cmd}`. `app_id` is a `.desktop` id resolvable by `Gio.DesktopAppInfo.new()`; `cmd` is an argv list for non-desktop entries (e.g. `piercing-note`). Accessors: `get_home_slots()`, `set_home_slots(slots)` with validation (cap 8, reject unknown types). Migration: if `home_slots` missing, empty list.
- [x] **1.2 Default layout seeding** — `launcher/src/default_layout.py`, re-spec'd by the 2026-07-20 parity sync: seed **Notes** (piercing-note else notes app), **Audio** folder (Audiobook, Music), **Comms** folder (Phone, Text, Email, Chat, SoftPhone), **Calendar**, **Tools** folder (browser labeled with its own name, Calculator, Camera, Photos). Every seeded label written to `app_labels`; stock clutter appended to `hidden_apps` (`STOCK_HIDDEN_APPS` — revisit the list once real devices show what ships); swipe-left seeded to `launch:<skippy>` when an app named "Skippy" exists (label-resolved, PWA id varies). Skip unresolvable members; no empty folders; flag set even if nothing resolved; **never overwrite a non-empty `home_slots`**. Wired into `window.py` init via `apply_default_layout()`. Unit-tested with injected fake resolvers.
- [x] **1.3 Render home from slots** — rewrite the home page in `home_launcher.py`/`window.py` to render `get_home_slots()`: one text row per slot, alignment from `config.home_alignment`, folder rows open a folder view. Delete `HOME_ITEMS` and the old pinned-row rendering once the slot model is live (search `window.py` for `pinned` usages).
- [x] **1.4 Folder view** — re-spec'd again by the 2026-07-21 parity sync: folders expand as **inline drop-downs under their slot** — members insert directly below the folder row (same typography, wrap-width rows following home alignment), the centered slot list grows/shrinks around them, **widgets stay visible**. Collapse on folder re-tap, member launch, or home re-render; gestures no longer force-dismiss. Long-press a member → shared folder-member menu (2.3).
- [x] **1.5 Edit mode** — long-press on home → edit mode (was previously ticked in error: the "existing" edit mode was dead pinned-list code referencing a button that never existed; re-implemented 2026-07-21). In edit mode: per-slot remove (✕), reorder (↑/↓ — GTK4 DnD stays out of scope), rename (folders and app labels), "Add app" when <8 (pick mode: the drawer opens and the next tapped app becomes a slot), "New folder", a Settings entry, and Done. Membership editing rides the drawer's "Add to folder" and the member menu's "Remove from folder" (Linux analog of Android's uninstall row).
- [x] **1.6 Launch dispatch** — single `launch_slot(slot)` helper: `app_id` → `Gio.DesktopAppInfo.launch()`, `cmd` → `subprocess.Popen`, label `Phone` with no target → built-in dialer surface (preserve the existing special-case). Record usage via `config.record_launch()`. Added `_launch_slot()` method in `window.py`.

## Workstream 2 — Drawer

Current drawer (`window.py` + `app_index.py`): bottom search (no auto-keyboard), A–Z jump strip, A–Z ↔ install-date sort, search-only hidden/home/folder apps, "Launcher Settings" entry last. Remaining gaps vs `design.md` "App drawer":

- [x] **2.1 Auto-launch single result** — new config bool `search_auto_launch` (default off). In the drawer search handler: when the query narrows to exactly one visible row and the user presses Enter — or, when the option is on, immediately — launch it. (`!` queries never auto-launch.)
- [x] **2.2 `!` web search fallback** — query starting with `!` → strip prefix, open `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=<urlencoded>` via `Gio.AppInfo.launch_default_for_uri()`. Also the Enter action when a non-`!` search has zero results.
- [x] **2.3 Long-press app menu** — re-spec'd by the parity syncs (`design.md` "App drawer" + "Folders" + "Dialogs & menus"). `app_labels` config + everywhere-rendering + rename-aware search are **done**; remaining: the long-press menu itself, one plain action list in this order: App info / Rename (prefilled entry) / Add to folder / Hide-Show / **Disable for…** (1-2-4-8 h picker writing `config.set_app_muted()` — enforcement already drops muted notifications in `main.py`) / Pin-Unpin / Move up-down. No uninstall (distro-specific). Renames afterwards update slots pointing at that `app_id`. **Folder members** (home and drawer, 2026-07-21 sync) get a shared shorter menu: App info / Rename / Disable for… / Move up / Move down — build it once, use it from both surfaces. All menus/dialogs themed per "Dialogs & menus"; rename entries commit on Enter. Implemented in `app_item_actions.py` (popover menus shared by drawer rows, drawer folder members, and home folder members); the drawer's old inline +/⊘ buttons are gone; pinned apps now sort first in browse (pin order), matching Android's pinned-priority drawer.
- [x] **2.4 Sort modes** — re-spec'd by the parity sync: a single toggle cycling **A–Z ↔ install date** (`.desktop` mtime), default A–Z. Usage and size sorts dropped from the drawer (launch counts still recorded for future use).
- [x] **2.5 Visibility** — re-spec'd by the parity sync: hidden apps, home-slot apps, and folder members are **search-only** — absent from the browse list, always surfaced by search (no config bools; this is the fixed behavior). Implemented in `window.py:_populate_apps`.
- [x] **2.6 One-handed drawer** — 2026-07-21 sync: drawer becomes a **~85% bottom sheet** (top ~15% of the screen free); search results **anchor at the bottom** just above the search field — short result sets sit at the bottom, overflowing sets read from the top. Implemented in `window.py:_build_apps_page`/`_populate_apps`.
- [x] **2.7 Folders in the drawer** — 2026-07-21 sync: folder slots (from `home_slots`) render as rows at the top of the browse list; tapping expands members **inline, indented under the row**; re-tap or swipe-right collapses; on expand the folder block scrolls to vertical center; expansion survives `_populate_apps` refreshes and collapses if the folder disappears. Member rows: no pin marker, long-press → folder-member menu (2.3).

## Workstream 3 — Themes

`config.py:23` has the right preset names but **wrong colors** vs the spec, and the wrong default.

- [x] **3.1 Align backgrounds** — set preset background (first hex) to the canonical values from `design.md`: amoled `#000000` (already right), graphite `#111827`, forest `#10261B`, ocean `#0F1C2E`, paper `#F3EEE2`, mist `#E6EDF5`. Rederive the surface/border shades per preset from its background (keep the current relative-lightness relationships); keep text colors near-white on dark presets, near-black on paper/mist. Keep `aura` untouched (Linux bonus).
- [x] **3.2 Default = AMOLED** — `DEFAULT_CONFIG['theme'] = 'amoled'` (spec default). Existing configs keep their saved choice.
- [x] **3.3 Custom solid color** — Settings: a hex entry (validate `#RRGGBB`) that builds an ad-hoc ThemePreset from one background color (auto-derive shades + pick black/white text by luminance). Persist as `theme: 'custom'`, `custom_background: '#…'`. Backgrounds are solid colors only — no wallpaper support, ever.
- [x] **3.4 Burgundy** — add `#2A1018` as a named custom-color suggestion (an extra background, not a preset — see `design.md` "Themes").

## Workstream 4 — Fonts

`FONT_FAMILIES` (`config.py`) has system-light/space-mono/jetbrains-mono/jetbrains-mono-nerd; **default is jetbrains-mono-nerd** per the parity sync. The spec adds:

- [x] **4.1 JetBrains Mono Nerd** — add `'jetbrains-mono-nerd': 'JetBrainsMono Nerd Font, JetBrains Mono, Monospace'`. Render gracefully when not installed (the fallback chain handles it).
- [x] **4.2 Custom font import** — config-first per WS15 (GUI row superseded): `config.install_custom_font(path)` copies a `.ttf`/`.otf` into `~/.local/share/fonts/`, runs `fc-cache -f` (silent on failure), reads the family via `fc-scan` (falls back to the file stem), stores `font: 'custom'` + `custom_font_family`. Custom font files are not part of backup.

## Workstream 5 — Widgets row (time / date / battery / weather)

Home header currently: clock, date, battery+network status strip, hardcoded. Spec (`design.md` "Home screen"):

- [x] **5.1 Widget config model** — `config.py`: `widgets` dict `{time: {enabled, order, tap}, date: {…}, weather: {…}, battery: {…}}`; `tap` ∈ `'default' | 'none' | {'app': app_id}`. Defaults per the parity sync: **all four enabled**, order time → date → weather → battery.
- [x] **5.2 Render + tap actions** — build the header from the config, ordered, skipping disabled (the hardcoded header already uses the right default order + `Mon, Jul 20` date format; make it config-driven). Tap `default`: time → installed clock app if any else none; date → calendar app; battery → power/settings page; weather → refresh. Tap `{'app': id}` → launch it.
- [x] **5.3 Settings section** — config-first per WS15 (GUI rows superseded): `widgets` dict validated/merged over defaults by `config.widgets` / `ordered_widgets()`; edit `~/.config/piercing-shell/config.json`.
- [x] **5.4 Weather widget** — new `launcher/src/weather.py`: Open-Meteo current-conditions endpoint (no API key), lat/lon from two config floats set manually in Settings (no GPS dependency — iio location is device-gated). Cache result to `~/.cache/piercing-shell/weather.json`; refresh at most every 15 min (per spec); render `18° Clear` text-only; **silent** (widget shows `--°`) when offline/unset. Fetch in a `threading.Thread(daemon=True)` + `GLib.idle_add` like `sms.py` does — never block the main loop. Unit-test the cache/staleness logic with injected clock + fetcher.

## Workstream 6 — Backup / restore (JSON)

Match the backup scope in `design.md` "Backup / restore":

- [x] **6.1 Export** — `launcher/src/backup.py`: `export_backup() -> dict` with `{version: 1, home_slots, app_labels, hidden_apps, widgets, theme (+custom color), font, text_size_scale, home_alignment, auto_lock_timeout, gestures (from gesture_config), search/visibility prefs}`. Explicitly excluded: PIN hash (security), launch counts (noise), custom font file. Settings button "Export backup" → write `~/piercing-wm-backup-YYYYMMDD.json`.
- [x] **6.2 Restore, atomic** — `restore_backup(path)`: parse → validate the **entire** payload against the schema (types, slot cap, known theme/font/gesture keys) → only then apply, via one `ShellConfig` write + one gestures write. Invalid payload = zero writes + visible error label (the no-write-on-invalid-payload guarantee). Settings button "Restore from backup" with a confirm step.
- [ ] **6.3 Tests** — round-trip test (export → restore onto fresh config → configs equal), and a table of malformed payloads (truncated JSON, wrong types, 9 slots, unknown gesture action) asserting nothing was written.

## Workstream 7 — Sounds

Assets already in `launcher/data/sounds/` (ringtone.mp3, notify.wav, comm-on.wav, alert.wav).

- [x] **7.1 Meson install** — `install_data` the four files to `datadir/piercing-shell/sounds/`.
- [x] **7.2 Player helper** — `launcher/src/sound.py`: resolve sound dir (installed path, fall back to repo-relative for dev runs); `play(name, loop=False)` / `stop()` via `paplay` subprocess (PipeWire's pactl frontend ships it everywhere we target); loop = respawn on exit from a daemon thread until stopped. Silent no-op if `paplay` is missing.
- [x] **7.3 Wire ringtone** — `call_ui.py`: loop `ringtone.mp3` on `show_incoming()`, stop on accept/decline/`end_call()`/remote hangup (all `StateChanged` paths in `modem_monitor.py` flow through `window.py._on_call_*` — stop in every terminal path).
- [x] **7.4 Wire notification sound** — `notif_daemon.py`: play `notify.wav` on `Notify` unless the shade's DnD tile is active (read the DnD state from `quick_actions.py` — it's currently a stub tile; give it a real boolean the daemon can query) or the notification carries the `suppress-sound` hint.
- [x] **7.5 Config toggles** — `sound_ringtone` / `sound_notifications` config bools (default on); GUI rows superseded by Workstream 15 (config-first).

## Workstream 8 — Gesture polish

`gesture_config.py` already has the right shape. Gaps:

- [x] **8.1 Arbitrary app targets** — swipe-left/right should launch *any chosen app* (`design.md` "Gestures"). `launch:<app_id>` validation/persistence in `gesture_config.py` is **done** (the default-layout seeder already binds Skippy this way); remaining: dispatch (`launch:` → `Gio.DesktopAppInfo.launch()`, fall back to `none` if uninstalled) and the Settings editor "Launch app…" → app picker.
- [x] **8.2 Swipe-down choice** — verify the Settings editor exposes `swipe_down_top` = notifications vs search (both already valid actions) and that the `search` action opens the drawer with keyboard focus. Fix if not.
- [x] **8.3 Prune dead slots** — moot as a GUI task: the gesture editor GUI is gone (config-file-first per WS15). `squeeze`/`double_press_power`/`fingerprint_swipe` stay in `_DEFAULTS`; their device-support requirement is documented in `docs/config.md` (15.2).

## Workstream 9 — Scripts (installer / deploy / init)

Installer pattern: whiptail menu, cached sudo, network check up front.

- [ ] **9.1 `scripts/install.sh`** — port from the vendored `scripts/reference/linux-phone-mod/` (see its README for what to drop): keep the whiptail TUI / cached-sudo / network-check pattern, POSIX sh. Menu: Install / Update / Install phone apps (→ 9.4/17) / Reboot / Exit. Install path: detect `apk` vs `apt` → install deps (`py3-gobject3 gtk4 libadwaita gtk4-layer-shell meson ninja rsync` | Debian equivalents `python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 libgtk4-layer-shell0 …`) → `meson setup build && meson install` from `launcher/` → install session files → run `scripts/bootstrap-dots.sh` (tolerate its current loud failure — the piercing-dots phone profile is a parallel task) → enable the shell service (systemd user unit or OpenRC, detected via `ps -p 1`).
- [ ] **9.2 `scripts/deploy.sh`** — dev-loop rsync deploy: env `PIERCING_DEVICE` (required), `PIERCING_USER` (default `user`); rsync `launcher/src/` → `~/piercing-shell/src/` on device, then restart the shell service over SSH, handling both systemd (`systemctl --user restart piercing-shell`) and OpenRC (`rc-service piercing-shell restart` via doas/sudo). `--dry-run` flag. Can't be end-to-end tested without a phone — test the argument handling and rsync command construction locally (echo mode).
- [ ] **9.3 OpenRC service** — `launcher/data/openrc/piercing-shell` init script equivalent to the systemd user unit (respawn on failure), meson-installed. postmarketOS default images are OpenRC; this unblocks device day one.
- [ ] **9.4 App-set menu entry** — "Install phone apps" install.sh menu item, distro-aware, superseded in scope by **Workstream 17** (the canonical app list lives there). Baseline utilities from the old installer stay: Neovim, Yazi, Flathub (FLOSS subset), UFW + allow SSH, Tailscale (repo where available, static-tgz fallback like the reference `apps.sh`), Waydroid (repo.waydro.id fallback). Skip Homebrew (broken on musl). Each item guarded by `command -v`/repo checks — the menu must never hard-fail on one missing package.
- [ ] **9.5 `shellcheck`** — all of `scripts/*.sh` and `devices/*/*.sh` pass `shellcheck -s sh` (or `-s bash` where the shebang says bash). Add fixes as needed.

## Workstream 10 — Tests & QA harness

- [ ] **10.1 `tests/` with pytest** — pure-logic coverage, no GTK imports needed: `config.py` (defaults, migration, slot validation), `default_layout.py` (fake resolver: full/partial/none resolution, never-overwrite), `backup.py` (6.3), `gesture_config.py` (unknown key/action rejection, `launch:` validation), `app_index.py` search matching + sort modes, weather cache logic. Guard GTK-importing modules out of test collection (`tests/conftest.py`).
- [ ] **10.2 CI-ish gate script** — `scripts/check.sh`: `py_compile` all sources + `pytest -q` + `shellcheck`. This is the pre-commit gate; run it before every commit.
- [ ] **10.3 Docs drift** — when a workstream lands, tick it here and update `design.md`/`launcher/README.md` if behavior diverged from spec (e.g. the APK-size sort omission).

## Workstream 11 — Lock screen v2 (swipe + notifications)

The lock screen stays ours — `lock_screen.py`, not phrog. Spec: `design.md` "Lock screen".

- [x] **11.1 Swipe to unlock** — add a `GestureDrag`/swipe recognizer to the lock surface. No PIN configured → upward swipe past threshold unlocks. PIN configured → keypad starts hidden; the swipe reveals it (slide-up reveal, same Revealer pattern as the shade). Keep lockout/fingerprint behavior intact.
- [x] **11.2 Lock-screen notifications** — feed from `notif_daemon.py`: text rows of app name + summary only (no bodies, no actions). Config `lock_screen_notifications`: `'summary'` (default) / `'count'` / `'off'`. Hidden while DnD is active (query the Workstream 13 state). Tap → reveal keypad/swipe hint; after unlock, open the shade. Rows clear from the lock surface on unlock but stay in the shade.
- [x] **11.3 Tests** — pure-logic coverage for the notification filtering (config modes, DnD suppression) with a fake daemon feed.

## Workstream 12 — Shade v2 (header: date/time, calendar, settings)

Spec: `design.md` "Notification shade & quick settings". Current shade has tiles+sliders+list but no header row.

- [x] **12.1 Date/time header** — top row of the shade: current date + time, updating while open (reuse the home clock tick pattern).
- [x] **12.2 Calendar expand** — tapping the date/time expands an inline month view: text-first grid (Mo–Su columns, current day emphasized), no events, prev/next month arrows. Tap again collapses. Pure GLib.DateTime math — unit-test month-grid generation (leap years, week starts).
- [x] **12.3 Settings entry** — right side of the header: a `Settings` text button → collapse the shade, open the launcher's settings page (`window.py` stack navigation via the existing IPC/window handle).
- [x] **12.4 Tile tier updates** — DnD and Focus become functional tier-2 tiles once Workstreams 13/14 land their state modules; keep `location`/`hotspot`/`auto_br` stubs hidden until backed by something real (same treatment as 8.3's hardware expander).

## Workstream 13 — Do Not Disturb (Pixel model)

Spec: `design.md` "Do Not Disturb". The `dnd` tile in `quick_actions.py` is currently a no-op — this workstream gives it a real backend. Land together with Workstream 7 (7.4 needs this state).

- [x] **13.1 State module** — `launcher/src/dnd.py`: config-backed `dnd_enabled`, `dnd_schedules` (list of `{days: [0-6], start: 'HH:MM', end: 'HH:MM'}`), `dnd_starred_numbers` (list). `is_active(now)` = manual toggle OR any schedule matches. Repeat-caller tracking: `note_call(number, when)` + `is_exception(number, when)` — same normalized number twice within 15 min, or number in starred list. Alarms always exempt by category hint.
- [x] **13.2 Notification enforcement** — `notif_daemon.py`: while active, no banner, no sound (7.4 hook); notifications still collect in the shade. Honor the alarm/urgency exemption.
- [x] **13.3 Call enforcement** — `window.py`/`call_ui.py` incoming-call path: while active, only exceptions ring (13.1); non-exceptions show silently in the call UI (no ringtone loop — coordinates with 7.3).
- [x] **13.4 Starred contacts** — `contacts.py` has no favorites yet: add a starred flag (long-press a contact row → Star/Unstar) persisted to `dnd_starred_numbers` via normalized number match.
- [x] **13.5 Tile wiring** — `quick_actions.py` `dnd` tile: real get/set against 13.1; tile shows active state including schedule-driven activation.
- [x] **13.6 Tests** — schedule matching (overnight ranges crossing midnight, day wrap), repeat-caller window, starred matching with formatting variants (`+1…` vs bare).

## Workstream 14 — Focus Mode (Pixel model)

Spec: `design.md` "Focus Mode". Nothing exists yet. Build the Pixel behavior first; polish comes later.

- [ ] **14.1 State module** — `launcher/src/focus_mode.py`: config `focus_apps` (list of app_ids), `focus_enabled`, `focus_schedules` (reuse the 13.1 schedule matcher — extract it into a shared helper), break state (`until` timestamp). API: `is_active()`, `is_paused_app(app_id)`, `start_break(minutes)`.
- [ ] **14.2 App pausing** — while active: paused apps render dimmed with a `· paused` suffix on home slots, folders, and drawer rows; tapping shows a one-line notice instead of launching (with `Take a break` / `Turn off Focus` actions). Gate in the single `launch_slot`/drawer dispatch path (Workstream 1.6) so every launch route is covered.
- [ ] **14.3 Notification holding** — `notif_daemon.py`: notifications from paused apps (match `desktop_entry`) are held in a hidden queue — no banner, no sound, not in the shade; on focus end (or break start), release them into the shade in one batch.
- [ ] **14.4 Take a break** — 5/10/15-minute break: focus suspends (apps launchable, notifications flow), auto-resumes at `until`. Surface: the paused-app notice + the Focus tile long-press.
- [ ] **14.5 Tile + selection** — Focus tile in `quick_actions.py` (tier 2). App selection lives in config (`focus_apps`) per the config-first rule; the drawer long-press menu (2.3) gains `Focus: pause this app` toggle as the on-device editor.
- [ ] **14.6 Tests** — break expiry/resume, hold-and-release queue ordering, paused-app matching, schedule reuse.

## Workstream 15 — Settings = system-only; config file is the API

Spec: `design.md` "Settings scope". Supersedes the "Settings:" GUI sub-items in 3.3, 4.2, 5.3, 7.5, 8.1 — implement those config keys, no GUI rows.

- [ ] **15.1 Shrink the page** — remove shell-preference rows from `window.py`'s settings page (theme/font/size/alignment/dark-mode/auto-lock dropdowns, index card, gesture card). Keep: APN/cellular, system update button, backup/restore actions. Add: about (version, device).
- [ ] **15.2 Config schema doc** — `docs/config.md`: every key in `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (plus gestures file) — name, type, default, effect. The config file is the public API; this doc is its reference. Wire a `Docs drift` note into 10.3.
- [ ] **15.3 Hot reload** — `Gio.FileMonitor` on `~/.config/piercing-shell/config.json`: on change, re-read and apply live (theme, font, sizes, alignment, slots, widgets, gestures via existing appliers). Debounce; never crash on a half-written/invalid file (keep last good config, log via `shell_log`).
- [ ] **15.4 Grow system coverage (TUI-style)** — the page becomes the single replacement for GNOME Settings + phosh-mobile-settings, shell-relevant subset only, text-first rows: WiFi network list + connect (NM D-Bus, password entry), Bluetooth scan/pair (BlueZ), sound output device picker (wpctl/pactl), battery status + charge info (UPower). Auto-lock timeout is a shell pref → config file (15.1), not this page. Mark scan/pair flows device-gated for real verification; build against NM/BlueZ D-Bus with graceful absence on the dev box.

## Workstream 16 — Keyboard: squeekboard + PiercingXX Colemak

Decision made: squeekboard, not wvkbd (design.md/README updated). Layout source: https://github.com/PiercingXX/furi-phone-colemak-keyboard (base + wide variants, plus `terminal/`, `email/`, `url/` purpose variants — squeekboard picks those by input-purpose hint, which covers "separate terminal keyboards" natively).

- [ ] **16.1 Vendor layouts** — copy the `squeekboard/` yaml tree from that repo into `launcher/data/squeekboard/` (keep subdir structure); meson-install to the user path squeekboard reads (`~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/` at install time via install.sh, or datadir + install.sh symlink — pick one, document it).
- [ ] **16.2 Session integration** — session files/`phoc.ini`: launch squeekboard instead of wvkbd; ensure the layer-shell keyboard layer ordering still puts the shade/lock above it. Add squeekboard to install.sh deps (apk `squeekboard` / apt `squeekboard`); note the user's temporary fork (github.com/PiercingXX/squeekboard) as fallback if distro packages lack needed fixes.
- [ ] **16.3 Default layout** — set Colemak as the active layout on first boot (gsettings `org.gnome.desktop.input-sources` sources squeekboard honors); first-boot wizard step optional-skip.
- [ ] **16.4 Sweep refs** — grep repo for `wvkbd`, update remaining mentions (docs, comments, deps lists).
- Device-gated: on-screen typing verification, purpose-variant switching in real apps.

## Workstream 17 — Default app set (the phone ships useful)

Extends 9.4 — this is the canonical list. Built-in already: **Phone** (dialer/call UI) and **Text** (SMS). All installs distro-aware, guarded, never hard-failing the menu.

- [ ] **17.1 Browser** — prefer Waterfox if an arm64 Linux build exists at port time (check; it's x86-centric historically), else Firefox (`firefox-esr`) + `mobile-config-firefox` for phone ergonomics. Set as default `x-scheme-handler/http`.
- [ ] **17.2 Calculator** — `gnome-calculator` (apk/apt both have it).
- [ ] **17.3 Tailscale** — repo install where recognized; static-tgz fallback exactly as the reference `apps.sh` does (keep the service-path sed). Post-install note: `sudo tailscale up`.
- [ ] **17.4 Skippy** — the phone entry point is the Skippy mobile PWA over Tailscale (`http://<tailscale-ip>:8282/mobile/`). Install = write a `.desktop` entry launching the browser in app/kiosk mode at that URL; host configurable (`skippy_host` in config or prompted by install.sh). Depends on 17.3.
- [ ] **17.5 Audiobookshelf** — Android client via Waydroid (17.6) or, self-hosted-server case, a PWA `.desktop` entry like 17.4 with prompted server URL. Do the PWA path first (no Waydroid dependency).
- [ ] **17.6 Waydroid + microG stack** — install Waydroid (repo.waydro.id fallback per reference). Then **device-gated**: initialize with a microG-enabled image (waydroid_script/MinDroid route — document exact steps in `devices/` notes), sign in microG, install Android apps: **YouTube Music** (not YouTube), **Synology Drive**, **Synology Photos**, **Synology Chat**. Verify Waydroid-exported `.desktop` entries appear in our drawer (`app_index.py` should pick them up — test with one app).
- [ ] **17.7 Google Calendar + Gmail** — decision recorded: via microG (17.6), i.e. Android Calendar/Gmail apps inside Waydroid, not native GNOME Online Accounts. Device-gated with 17.6.
- [ ] **17.8 Utilities baseline** — from the reference installer: Neovim (distro package on apk; nightly build only where feasible), Yazi (cargo/distro — no Homebrew), UFW + allow SSH, `wl-clipboard`. Fonts: the shell already bundles its own — skip the desktop font pile.

## Workstream 18 — First-boot welcome walkthrough (build LAST)

`first_boot.py` already does PIN + theme. This extends it into the usage walkthrough — explicitly the final workstream; don't start until 1–17 are stable.

- [ ] **18.1 Walkthrough pages** — after PIN/theme: interactive gesture tour (swipe up → drawer, swipe down → shade, sideways → switcher, long-press → edit mode — each page waits for the actual gesture, with a `Skip` always visible), then one page each: shade/quick settings, DnD & Focus, "everything is a text file" (point at `~/.config/piercing-shell/` + `docs/config.md`).
- [ ] **18.2 Re-runnable** — `piercing-shell --welcome` (or IPC verb) to replay the tour; mention it on the final page.
- [ ] **18.3 Keyboard step** — if squeekboard + Colemak layouts present (16), a try-the-keyboard page with a text field; skip silently when absent.

---

## Suggested order

1 → 3 → 2 → 13+7 (DnD state first, sounds consume it) → 10.1/10.2 (early, then continuous) → 12 → 11 → 4 → 8 → 5 → 14 → 6 → 15 → 16 → 9+17 → 10.3 → 18 last. Workstream 1 first: everything else touches config, and the slot migration is the riskiest schema change — land it while the surface area is small. 15 late on purpose: shrink the settings page only after the config keys it defers to (3/4/5/7/8) exist. 18 is explicitly last.

## Blocked — do NOT attempt (needs hardware or the user)

- **Flashing / device bring-up** (Fairphone 5 fastboot, Librem 5 session swap, FLX1 research) — `devices/*/notes.md` hold the checklists.
- **lisgd/wob/squeekboard runtime integration, threshold calibration, telephony testing** — phone required (incl. DnD ring suppression, 13.3).
- **Waydroid + microG bring-up and Android app installs** (17.6/17.7) — phone required; scripting the Waydroid *install* is fine, everything after `waydroid init` is device work.
- **Final product rename** (`piercing-shell` → ?) — user decision; when made, rename DBus namespace, socket, service, meson project in one commit.
- **piercing-dots phone profile** — separate agent, separate repo. This repo only consumes `install.sh --profile phone` via `scripts/bootstrap-dots.sh`.
- **Publishing/releases** — none until first device boot.
