# XX-WM — piercing-dots phone-profile bootstrap
# Runs ON THE PHONE. Clones piercing-dots and applies its phone profile.
#
# Contract with piercing-dots (see repo handoff prompt):
#   ./install.sh --profile phone   must exist, be POSIX sh, detect apk vs apt,
#   never assume x86 / GNOME / systemd, and install only the phone subset:
#   kitty, nvim (+ daily-note entry point `piercing-note`), yazi, bash+starship,
#   and the maintenance script.
#
# Until that lands upstream this script is a stub that fails loudly.
